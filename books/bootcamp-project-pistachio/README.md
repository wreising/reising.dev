UCI Bootcamp Project 

The idea of this application is to help create itineraries for upcoming vacation trips. Users can log their plans as well as viewing a few features, such as the weather of their location and the status of the closest airport. Utilizing APIs, we were able to pull information for these features and apply it to our app.
