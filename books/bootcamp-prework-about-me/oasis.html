    <p>
        Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. They were originally known as the Rain before evolving into Oasis, and initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), and Tony McCarroll (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, finalising the band's core line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members.
