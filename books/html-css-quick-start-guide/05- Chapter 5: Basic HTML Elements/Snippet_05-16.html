<div class="div-example">
<p>This is a large block of text. We are using multiple lines.</p>
<p>As we can see, we can use paragraphs inside div elements. This serves to break up the layout.</p>
<p>We can have multiple paragraphs inside a div, but they are all still seen as part of the div, decorated with the "div-example" class.</p>
<p>On occasion, we may want to<span class="span-example">style a single line of text without any breaks</span>, so we enclose it within a span element.</p>
